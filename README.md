## The Kicad files for building something around the CH572D

This is one of my first footprint and schematic designs, so if anything is wrong with it raise an issue. 
Theres currently no 3D design for this, if someone wants to add it they can send in a request
I made 2 versions of the layout design, 1 full sized one taken directly from the datasheet

And 1 small sized version without all of the details on the pins
