## Kicad Library for the CH572D

This is one of my first footprint and schematic designs, so if anything is wrong with this message me or raise an issue
<br>
Theres currently no 3D design for this, if someone wants to add it they can send in a request
<br>
I made 2 versions of the layout design, 1 full sized one taken directly from the datasheet

And 1 small sized version without all of the details on the pins

I designed this with the help of its [datasheet](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH572DS1_PDF.html) and the [EasyEDA](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/WCH_Jiangsu_Qin_Heng-CH572D/C46597863)
